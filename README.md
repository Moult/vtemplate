# vtemplate

Web interfaces generally require a lot of different technologies to be glued
together. The technologies are different for each web application, and vary
greatly in terms of required complexity. This means that housekeeping decisions
and repository structure can be a little tiresome.

I have put together a basic boilerplate in a few languages for my own (and
perhaps your) convenience. They are not coupled to any particular set of
libraries (although they do recommend some commonly used ones), are _extremely_
minimal, and you are expected to develop further, restructure, or even delete
completely as appropriate to your specific project.
